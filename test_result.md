# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "✅ WORKING - Enhanced listings view loads correctly with search bar, location filter dropdown, and price range filter. Search functionality works (tested with 'agricultural land' and 'land'). Price range filters work correctly (Under ₹1 Lac, ₹1-5 Lac, ₹5-10 Lac options tested). Real-time filtering works when multiple filters are applied simultaneously. Clear Filters button functions properly. Shows 'No listings found' message when no active listings exist in database, which is expected behavior."

Investigated and found API endpoint mismatches and authentication issues between frontend and backend. Fixed all endpoint URLs, field name mappings, and authentication headers. The issues were: 1) Post Land: frontend called '/api/listings' but backend is '/api/post-land' 2) My Listings: frontend called '/api/listings/preview/{id}' but backend is '/api/my-listings' 3) Broker Signup: frontend called '/api/brokers/register' but backend is '/api/broker-signup'.

    message: "🚨 CRITICAL PAYMENT SYSTEM ISSUE IDENTIFIED - Conducted comprehensive testing of Razorpay payment integration as requested in review. ROOT CAUSE FOUND: The reason users clicking 'Complete Payment' don't see Razorpay modal is because backend payment order creation fails with 'Authentication failed' error. TECHNICAL DETAILS: ✅ Payment endpoints (/api/create-payment-order, /api/verify-payment) are implemented correctly ✅ Authentication and database operations work properly ✅ Payment verification logic is functional ❌ CRITICAL ISSUE: Invalid Razorpay API keys in backend/.env - RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET='thisissecretkey' is a placeholder, not valid test key ❌ This causes all payment order creation to fail with 500 error ❌ Frontend cannot receive valid order data to initialize Razorpay modal. SOLUTION: Replace placeholder Razorpay keys with valid test keys from Razorpay dashboard. The payment system architecture is sound but blocked by invalid API credentials."
