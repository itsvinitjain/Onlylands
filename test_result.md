# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "✅ WORKING - Enhanced listings view loads correctly with search bar, location filter dropdown, and price range filter. Search functionality works (tested with 'agricultural land' and 'land'). Price range filters work correctly (Under ₹1 Lac, ₹1-5 Lac, ₹5-10 Lac options tested). Real-time filtering works when multiple filters are applied simultaneously. Clear Filters button functions properly. Shows 'No listings found' message when no active listings exist in database, which is expected behavior."

  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Backend testing completed. The backend is correctly storing and serving images as base64. The issue is in the frontend or in the payment flow. Images are only returned by the API when listings have status='active', which requires payment verification.

Key findings: ✅ INTEGRATION IS WORKING: Code implementation is correct, environment variables are loaded, Twilio client is initialized, and API connectivity is established. Fixed critical issue: Added missing load_dotenv() import to server.py - environment variables now properly loaded from .env file. ✅ TWILIO CREDENTIALS: All credentials properly configured (TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID: AC19d24320..., TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN: e2e7492dde..., TWILIO_VERIFY_SERVICE_SID: VA3b54f2c7...). ✅ API CONNECTIVITY: Successfully connecting to Twilio API and receiving proper error responses. ✅ ERROR HANDLING: All scenarios handled correctly (missing phone, invalid phone format). ⚠️ CONFIGURATION ISSUE: SMS delivery channel is disabled in Twilio account - this is a Twilio account setting, not a code issue. The integration is working correctly - code connects to Twilio API and gets proper responses. To enable actual SMS sending, contact Twilio support to enable SMS delivery channel.

    message: "🚨 CRITICAL OTP LOGIN ISSUE IDENTIFIED - After comprehensive testing of the homepage login for sellers and overall OTP login flow, I found a critical issue: ❌ OTP LOGIN COMPLETELY BROKEN: Both seller and broker login fail at the OTP sending stage with 'Failed to send OTP' error. Backend logs show 'Delivery channel disabled: SMS' from Twilio API. ❌ DEMO MODE REMOVED: The demo mode functionality (OTP '123456') that was previously working is no longer present in the current backend implementation. ✅ UI FLOW WORKING: All navigation, forms, validation, and error handling work correctly. The issue is specifically with the OTP sending/verification backend functionality. ✅ OTHER FEATURES WORKING: View Listings page, search functionality, filters, and navigation all work correctly. ⚠️ MOBILE RESPONSIVENESS: Some mobile layout issues detected in listings view.

    message: "🚨 CRITICAL BROKER LOGIN BUG DISCOVERED - Conducted comprehensive testing of current OTP login flow implementation as requested. DETAILED FINDINGS: ✅ SELLER LOGIN FULLY FUNCTIONAL: Homepage loads correctly, login choice screen works, seller login form functional, demo mode message appears ('Service temporarily unavailable. Use OTP 123456 for testing'), OTP verification with '123456' works perfectly, successful login with 'Welcome, Seller' message, logout functionality works, user state persistence works, seller-specific features visible, mobile responsiveness excellent, View Listings functionality works, all navigation flows work properly. ❌ CRITICAL BROKER LOGIN BUG: When users select 'Login as Broker' and complete the entire OTP flow with demo OTP '123456', they are incorrectly logged in as 'Seller' instead of 'Broker'. This means the user_type parameter is not being handled correctly in the broker authentication flow. Brokers cannot access broker-specific features and are given seller permissions instead. This is a critical authentication bug that completely breaks the user type differentiation system. The frontend UI works correctly, but the backend is not respecting the user_type parameter for broker logins. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Fix the broker login user_type handling in the OTP verification endpoint."
