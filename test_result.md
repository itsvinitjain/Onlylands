# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "✅ HYBRID OTP FUNCTIONALITY FULLY RESOLVED - Conducted comprehensive testing of the updated hybrid OTP login endpoints with Twilio fallback to demo mode as requested in the review. PERFECT RESULTS: All 13 tests passed with 100% success rate. The hybrid OTP system is now working flawlessly: ✅ Send OTP Endpoint - Returns demo_mode status with demo_info message when Twilio SMS is disabled, works for both seller and broker user types ✅ Verify OTP Endpoint - Accepts demo OTP '123456' for both user types, creates users correctly, generates JWT tokens ✅ Fallback Logic - Seamlessly falls back to demo mode when Twilio SMS delivery fails, demo mode works consistently ✅ Error Handling - Proper validation for missing phone numbers, invalid OTP codes, missing parameters ✅ User Management - New user creation and existing user login working correctly ✅ JWT Token Generation - Working with proper user data structure. The previous critical authentication blocker has been completely resolved. Users can now successfully complete the login process using demo OTP '123456' when Twilio SMS is unavailable. The hybrid approach ensures the application remains functional regardless of Twilio service status."

    message: "🚨 CRITICAL BROKER LOGIN BUG DISCOVERED - Conducted comprehensive testing of current OTP login flow implementation as requested. DETAILED FINDINGS: ✅ SELLER LOGIN FULLY FUNCTIONAL: Homepage loads correctly, login choice screen works, seller login form functional, demo mode message appears ('Service temporarily unavailable. Use OTP 123456 for testing'), OTP verification with '123456' works perfectly, successful login with 'Welcome, Seller' message, logout functionality works, user state persistence works, seller-specific features visible, mobile responsiveness excellent, View Listings functionality works, all navigation flows work properly. ❌ CRITICAL BROKER LOGIN BUG: When users select 'Login as Broker' and complete the entire OTP flow with demo OTP '123456', they are incorrectly logged in as 'Seller' instead of 'Broker'. This means the user_type parameter is not being handled correctly in the broker authentication flow. Brokers cannot access broker-specific features and are given seller permissions instead. This is a critical authentication bug that completely breaks the user type differentiation system. The frontend UI works correctly, but the backend is not respecting the user_type parameter for broker logins. IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Fix the broker login user_type handling in the OTP verification endpoint."

    message: "🎉 BROKER LOGIN BUG COMPLETELY FIXED - Conducted comprehensive testing of the broker login user_type bug fix as specifically requested in the review. PERFECT TEST RESULTS (12/12 tests passed, 100% success rate): ✅ SELLER LOGIN TEST - Send OTP for seller works correctly, verify OTP returns JWT token with user_type: 'seller', user object has correct user_type: 'seller' ✅ BROKER LOGIN TEST (CRITICAL BUG FIX) - Send OTP for broker works correctly, verify OTP returns JWT token with user_type: 'broker', user object has correct user_type: 'broker' ✅ USER TYPE SWITCH TEST - Successfully tested switching between seller and broker logins with same phone number, database user_type updated correctly when switching user types ✅ JWT TOKEN VERIFICATION - Decoded JWT tokens from both seller and broker logins, verified user_type field matches login request type, verified other token fields (user_id, phone_number, expiry) are correct ✅ EDGE CASE TESTING - Missing phone number validation (400 error), invalid OTP rejection (400 error), missing parameters validation (400 error). THE CRITICAL BUG HAS BEEN COMPLETELY RESOLVED: When users select 'Login as Broker' and complete OTP verification with demo OTP '123456', they are now correctly logged in as 'Broker' with proper JWT token user_type: 'broker' and database user_type: 'broker'. The fix ensures JWT tokens always reflect the current login request's user_type instead of using the existing user's user_type from database. All expected results from the review request have been achieved."
